# JRCLUST

## Note

**JRCLUST is no longer being actively maintained.**
If you still want to use JRCLUST, we recommend using the [latest release](https://github.com/JaneliaSciComp/JRCLUST/releases/tag/v4.1.0) or cloning from `main`, rather than `master`.

JRCLUST is a scalable and customizable package for spike sorting on [high-density silicon probes](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24636).
It is written in MATLAB and CUDA.

JRCLUST was originally developed by [James Jun](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/team/james-jun/).

## Installing JRCLUST

If you'd like to
test the latest development code, you can [clone the
repository](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) to
your computer. If you want to stay on a release, head to the [releases
page](https://github.com/JaneliaSciComp/JRCLUST/releases) and download
the latest release.

Run the following command in MATLAB (you may want to add it to your [startup
script](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/startup.html)):

```matlab
addpath('/path/to/JRCLUST');
```

You may also need to recompile your CUDA codes if you're not on Windows.
Do this with

```matlab
jrclust.CUDA.compileCUDA();
```
