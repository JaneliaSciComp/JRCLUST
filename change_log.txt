James Jun, HHMI-Janelia Research Campus, Applied Physics and Instrumentation Group

--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2017/9/17]
Bugfix: Program crashed when the number of clusters were less than 7.
  The color grouping size is 7 (# colors for cluster mean waveforms).
  Now it's possible to have any number of clusters.
Speed improvement (~40%) when fft cleanup is disabled (set fft_thresh=0).
  Previously unnecessary data conversion was performed even when fft cleanup is not used.
jrc import-nsx myrecording.ns5 myprobe.prb
  JRC imports Neuroshare format and export the analog channels to .bin file.
  JRC generates .prm file by combining the .bin and .prb file names (e.g. binfile_prbfile.prm) 

[2017/9/15]
jrc import-intan mychannels-A*.dat myprobe.prb
  JRC imports intan recordings, which saved each channel as -A###.dat files.
  JRC combines .dat files to a single .bin file and saves to the directory above.
  JRC generates .prm file by combining the .bin and .prb file names (e.g. binfile_prbfile.prm) 

[2017/9/14]
Bugfix: Waveform correlation based auto-merging
  Some cluster pairs were not merged although their correlation is above the maxCorWav threshold
jrc makeprm myfile.bin mytemplate.prm
  This create a prm file based on a template file for a given .bin file
jrc batch filelist.batch mytemplate.prm
  This creates .prm files for the list of .bin files using mytemplate.prm
  If mytemplate.prm is not specified, default.prm is used
jrc batch fileliist.batch command
  This command works for batch file containing .prm files. 
  Default command is spikesort if omited
jrc batch fileliist.batch command
  This command works for batch file containing .prm files. 
  Default command is spikesort if omited
jrc3 export-prm myparams.prm (myparam_full.prm)
  Export complete list of parameters to a new file.
  If the second argument is omitted, the current parameter file is updated.
  If some parameter values are missing, they will be copied from the default template file (default.prm).
New feature: when myparam_jrc.mat file is written, myparam_full.prm is created that contains the full parameter settings
  If the parameter file name is myparam.prm, jrc creates myparam_full.prm whenever myparam_jrc.mat is updated

[2017/9/12]
Improved rho-delta detrending
  lin-log fit using quadatic function, delta1_cut=0.6, rho_cut=-3 recommended
  Previously used log-log fit using linear function
Waiting hour-glass icon error is resolved.

[2017/8/18]
"jrc preview" UI is backward compatible with Matlab R2015b.
User interface: waiting dialog while plotting to prevent keyboard press while busy.

[2017/8/17]
Display bugfix: jrc traces spike display fixed
New user interface: jrc preview
  Change and preview threshold and sorting paramters
  Find optimal thresholds for motion rejection (blank_thresh), adaptive notch filter (fft_thresh), spike threshold (qqFactor).
  Save spike threshold per channel to a file ("vcFile_thresh = myparam_thresh.mat") and apply them to the entire recordings.  
  Auto-commit changes to the .prm file  
  Detect bad sites using max. pairwise correlation of cleaned raw traces (after notch filter and before AP-band filter).
Spike detection improved for smaller and narrower spikes
  Negative turning point detection uses different algorithm by checking left and right neighbors.
    Previously it was possible to randomly miss some of a negative turning point that has less than two neighbors below threshold.

[2017/8/7]
Bugfix: when multiple files are merged, the file ordering will follow the correct order
  by using the file creation time is stored in the .meta file (SpikeGLX generated).
    If .meta file is not availble, file creation time is used to sort the files.
"jrc dir file*.bin mylist.txt" will generate a list of binary files and 
  order them according to the file creation time.
You can specify a file sorting option at the end "jrc dir file*.bin mylist.txt [0-4]".
  0: alphabetical order
  1: meta file stored file creation time
  2: file created time
  3: file modified time
  4: numerical order in the file names   
"jrc makeprm mylist.txt myprobe.prb" will create a prm file called "mylist_myprobe.prm".
  'makeprm' now accepts .txt file containing list of binary files
  If .meta file (SpkeGLX) is available, it will be used to auto-fill the .prm file.
  If .meta file is unavailable, user will be asked to provide required info (sampling rate, # channels/file, uV/bit, probe file).

[2017/8/4]
'blank_period_ms' is now using millisecond unit. Previous it was using second unit.

[2017/8/2]
Bugfix: 'makeprm' sometimes couldn't create .prm file. Now fixed.

[2017/8/1]
Bugfix: 'makeprm' sometimes couldn't locate .meta file. Now fixed.

[2017/7/31]
'makeprm' command now works with a wild-card file path (csFile_merge = 'f*.bin')
  e.g. "jrc makeprm mybin*.bin myprobe.prb" creates a parameter file "mybin_myprobe.prm" by removing '*' characters and adding the probe file name.
  makeprm assumes the file format is the same for all binary files (same number of channels, sampling rate, uV/bit).
Multiple file joining (csFile_merge) now currectly orders files with numbers ('f1.bin', 'f2.bin', 'f10.bin'}
  Previously the files are ordered according to the modified timestamp. 
    The listing order can fail if the files get copied to another location, by alphabetically sorting the file order {'f1.bin', 'f10.bin', 'f2.bin'}
csFile_merge now accepts cell arrrays of wild-card
  csFile_merge = {'f1*.bin', 'f2*.bin'} is now valid.
  csFile_merge = {'f1*.bin', 'f2.bin'} is now valid.
  csFile_merge = {'f1*.bin', 'f2.bin', 'f3*.bin'} is now valid.
  csFile_merge = {'f1.bin', 'f2.bin'} is still valid.
  csFile_merge = 'f1*.bin' is still valid.

[2017/7/26]
vcFile_trial supports csv file format. 

[2017/7/25]
makeprm command can automatically determine the Neuropixels probe option from the meta file.
  If the probe is not a Neuropixels probe, user is asked to provide the probe file name.
  Call "jrc makeprm myrecording.bin myprobe.prb" to explicitly state the probe file.

[2017/7/23]
"jrc traces" UI improvement. 
  Filter on/off is indicated on the figure title bar.
  Mouse pointer changes while loading the data.
  'vcFilter_show' can override the filter setting for display purpose.
    Choices: {'', 'bandpass', 'sgdiff'}. '' uses vcFilter setting.

[2017/7/21]
Default parameter file template (default.prm) is cleaned up.
  Deprecated parameters and developer's parameters are organized separately.
SpikeGLX-generated .meta file is no longer required.
  If the meta file is missing, user is asked to provide sampling rate, uV/bit scaling factor and number of channels stored in the file.
Quality score now includes the microvolt amplitude unit.
  Minimum (S_clu.vrVmin_uv_clu) and peak-to-peak (S_clu.vrVpp_uv_clu) amplitudes from the center site is calculated.
UI: Automated deletion is implemnted. Clusters are automatically deleted based on the criteria
  Based on Unit SNR (Filtered peak amplitude divided by the RMS (Quiroga) for the primary channel
  Based on the # spike/unit.
  Undo is possible after automatic deletion.
UI: PCA feature display uses global principal vectors if vcFet='gpca' feature is used.
  Previously PCA feature display used principal vectors computed for each site.
  Site-specific principal vectors are used if vcFet='gpca' feature is not used.
Bugfix: quality metrics are now updated after manual cluster editing (delete,merge,split).
Bugfix: # of clusters displayed in "Cluster rho-delta" plot is corrected.
Cluster integrity is now automatically checked after each manual operation. 
  All cluster-related fields must have the same number of clusters.
  Manual operation is updated if and only if the automated cluster integrity check succeeds.

[2017/7/19]
New clustering feature is implemented (vcFet='gpca'). This feature is now a default feature.
  The performance of 'gpca' feature resulted in 50% lower median false positives and lower false negatives compared to the 'cov' feature.
  'nPcPerChan=3' sets number of features per channel.
There is now a filter option called (vcFilter='sgdiff'). Set this to (vcFilter='bandpass') if you want to apply a bandpass IIR filter. 
  The option below are for the Savitzky-Golay differentiator filter (vcFilter='sgdiff'), which is set by default.
    Set 'nDiff_filt=2' to set the filter tap order (+/-2 samples). Increasing this number will smooth the signal and decreasing will sharpen the signal.
  The options below are for the bandpass IIR filter (vcFilter='bandpass').
    Set 'freqLim=[300 6000]' to apply a bandpass filter from 300-6000 Hz. 
    Set 'freqLim=[300 inf]' to apply a high-pass filter with a 300 Hz cut-off.
    Set 'freqLim=[0 300]' to apply a low-pass filter with a 300 Hz cut-off.
    Set 'fEllip=1' to apply an Elliptic filter. Set it to 0 if you want to use a Butterworth filter.
    Set 'filtOrder=3' to apply a third-order bandpass filter.
'vcDetrend_postclu=global' option results in a more reliable detrending for the cluster center finding (rho-delta plot). 
  Default parameter values are set to delta1_cut=0.6, rho_cut=-3.
  delta1_cut indicate log10(z-score). For example, delta1_cut=0.6 corresponds to z_thresh = 10^0.6 = 4.0 after detrending.

[2017/7/14]
"jrc batch my_prm_files.batch" command now lists list of errors found during the batch process
dc_percent behavior changed. Now dc_percent is applied to local neighbors sharing the same
  primary site only. Previously neighbors sharing primary or secondary sites were included,
  leading to overestimation of the distance-cutoff.
  dc_percent default value is set back to 2.
"vcFilter" paramter is added to clarify whether differentiation filter or bandpass filter is used.
  vcFilter='sgdiff' uses nDiff_filt value to run the Savitzky-Golay differentiator.
  vcFilter='bandpass' uses freqLim value to run a band-pass filter.
    Butterworth filter is used if "fEllip=0", and otherwise elliptic filter is used.
  'filtOrder=3' sets the filter order to 3.
Drift view shows spikes from a specific shank. Modify iShank_show=1 in the prm file (shows the first shank by default).


[2017/7/13]
Bugfix: L12677 index range error is fixed
 viKeep_spk = find(viTime_spk >= ilim_spk(1) & ilim_spk <= ilim_spk(2));

[2017/7/12]
Matlab path is temporarily reset to the system default when JRCLUST starts 
  to prevent namespace collision error. The path is reset to user-specified 
  value after restarting the Matlab session.

[2017/7/7]
Waveform merging now checks other clusters whose primary or secondary sites 
  overlap with the cluster's secondary site (second center).
default value of dc_percent changed (2->1). This results in lower false positives without affecting false negatives.
fft_thresh GPU error is corrected. 

[2017/7/6]
Quality metrics added: ISI ratio, L-ratio, Isolation Distance
  Variable names: "S_clu.{vrIsiRatio_clu, vrLRatio_clu, vrIsoDist_clu}"
  Local neighborhood is selected by searching for all spikes sharing the same 
    primary or secondary sites with the cluster center.
Bugfix: average waveform is recalculated after removing outlier spikes.
Bugfix: Multi-shank neighboring sites are calculated correctly, now always taken from the same shank.
ISI violation is automatically fixed by removing spikes that are double-detected.
"jrc manual": deleted spikes are now hidden.

[2017/7/5]
Neuropixels probe layout corrected. Channel 1 is in the middle column but previously it was on the edge
  (imec3.prb, imec3_opt1, imec3_opt2 imec3_opt3 imec3_opt4 corrected)

[2017/7/4]
Default parameter changed to improve spike detection and clustering.
  qqThresh = 5; nDiff_filt = 2;
Improved post-cluster merging based on the location of the primary and secondary peaks.
  Previously the merging decision was considered for cluster pairs within 50 um.
  The new scheme yields more specific cluster merging, thur reducing false cluster merges.
Removal of outlier spikes based on the Mahalnobis distance.
  thresh_mad_clu = 7.5; (default). Set to 0 to disable this.
  This will significantly reduce the false positive spikes with minimal increase of missed spikes.

[2017/6/29]
Matched filter detection is supported (set vcFilter_detect = 'matched';)
  This convolves the spike wave shape to the filtered traces. 

[2017/6/27]
Bugfix: JRC3 now supports energy and PCA features.
Significantly more reliable spike detection at the edges of memory loading blocks. 
  Extra spike detected due to the edge effect is ~0.1 ppm per channel per memory load.
Hard threshold setting is fixed (spkThresh_uV).

[2017/6/23]
Bugfix: "traces" command multiple time segment viewing now adds time separators
  jrc2 and jrc3 updated and time offset values are shown.

[2017/6/22]
"traces" command now supports multiple time segments (nTime_traces parameter).
  nTime_traces = 1 shows a single time segment as previously.
GPU is disabled for manual curation (jrc manual)

[2017/6/19]
Code dependencies to external functions removed in jrc2 and jrc3.
Run "jrc3 dependencies" to show dependencies to toolboxes and other functions.

[2017/6/15]
Paged load uses overlapping time to reduce missed spikes at the edges due to filter edge effect.
  "nPad_filt" controls number of samples for overlap.
  This feature is added to both jrc2 and jrc3.

[2017/6/14]
JRCLUST version 3 is released. Run "jrc3" or "jrc" to use this version.
  Substantial improvement with dataset with probe drift. 
    Set "nTime_clu" to 1 if no drift occurs, 2 or higher if drift occurs fast
  "jrc3 detect" runs spike detection and feature extraction.
  "jrc3 sort" runs clustering and posthoc merging.
  "jrc3 auto" runs posthoc merging.
  "jrc3 manual, spikesort-manual, sort-manual, or auto-manual" runs manual UI.
Better global noise rejection by blanking noisy period.
  "blank_thresh" sets the MAD threshold for the channel mean-based activity rejection
  "blank_period_ms" sets the duration of the blanking. Useful to remove licking or motion artifacts  


[2017/6/6]
"jrc2 auto" command is added. This performs re-clustering after updating the
  post-clustering parameters such as "delta1_cut" (cluster confidence).
  This must be done after running "jrc2 sort" or "jrc2 spikesort".
  This command uses the features previously computed.
Local CAR now uses "nSites_ref" channels with the least activities (lowest stdev).
  Previously reference sites were selected by choosing four furthest sites from the center.
If vcSpkRef="nmean" is used, the features from the local reference sites are set to zero.
  This excludes features from the sites with low SNR.

[2017/6/4]
Robust GPU memory processing. If GPU memory error occurs during spike detection the 
  processing is performed in CPU after transfered the data to the main memory 

[2017/5/29]
Default setting changed to produce lower false negative under drift.
  Now checks 2x greater spatial range. This doesn't hurt performance for non-drifting dataset
Post-cluster waveform-based merging became 2x faster.
  Now checks 2x greater spatial range for merging. 
  A cluster pair must have at least 4 overlapping sites

[2017/5/24]

  Type "jrc2 doc" to view the PDF manual.
Improved history logging behavior
  All manual operations are stored in "cS_log" variable.
  Manual operations are reset after automated sorting.
  Ten last performed operations are stored in RAM. 
  The number of logged entries can be changed in "MAX_LOG" parameter.
  Lastest program state is automatically saved to the disk for each manual operation.

[2017/5/12]
Bugfix: Spike detection error fixed when refrac_factor >1 was used
  The previous version assigned an incorrect site # for the spike being detected.
  This is a serious bug and update is recomended.
Spike merging speed is improved.

[2017/5/6]
Bugfix: Multishank post-hoc merging error fixed
Added jrc2 batch-mat myfile_batch.mat command
 myfile_batch.mat contains csFile_bin (binary files) and csFile_template (template files)
 csFile_template can be a string or cell strings
 Optionally provide csFile_prb (probe files), which can be a string or cell strings (for each .bin file)

[2017/5/5]
History menu is added to GUI. This feature allows you to undo/redo manual actions,
  and restore to previous state if JRCLUST crashes. Restart JRCLUST and select 
  the last action saved in the "History" menu (left of Help menu).

[2017/5/3]
Bugfix: New update (4/26) can display older format saved.
Faster post-hoc merging
Faster merging and splitting
Improved visualization for the cluster correlation matrix (FigWavCor)

[2017/4/26]
'nneigh_min_detect' parameter is introduced. This sets the minimum number of neighbors around spikes
  below the negative detection threshold. Set between [0,1,2]. 1 is recommended.
  Previous version used hard-coded value of 2 which lead to missing spikes.

[2017/4/25]
'nDiff_filt' parameter is intorduced to control the smoothing parameter of the differentiator filter.   
  Set nDiff_filt between 1-4. 3 is recommended. Higher number results in more agressive smoothing. 
  Previous version used 4 but it smoothed too aggressively leading to loss of small and narrow spike waveforms
  To skip differentiator sgfilter, set nDiff_filt = []; 
'tlim_load' parameter is now enabled, which sets the time range of data to load (in sec unit).
  For multiple file merging, the time base refers to each individual file and it applies for all files being loaded

[2017/4/21]
Bugfix: Split selection refinement fixed (polygon adjustment didn't take effect)
Bugfix: Raw waveform display works with the dataset sorted by the previous version 
Spike position view (bottom-left) shows 4x more spikes
Color can be changed for projection view by changing 'mrColor_proj' in the .prm file
  mrColor_proj = [r0 g0 b0; r1 g1 b1; r2 g2 b2]; % 0: background; 1: Cluster selected; 2: Cluster compared

[2017/4/20]
Multiple feature viewing enabled. Go to menu and select 'Projection' to change features to display
  available features: {'vpp', 'cov', 'pca'}. This affects the projection and time figures.
  To change a default feature to display, set 'vcFet_show' to one of {'vpp', 'cov', 'pca'} in the .prm file.

[2017/4/19]
Raw waveform is enabled for manual clustering. set 'fWav_raw_show=1' to enable raw waveform view.

[2017/4/5]
Instruction manual updated (install.txt). Updated installation from the website (jrc2.zip).
Added feature export command. 
  Run "jrc2 export-fet" and this outputs mrFet, miFet_sites to the workspace.

[2017/4/4]
Trace view: For multi-file sorting, you can select files from the command line 
    instead of from the dialog box, which sometimes run out of the monitor space.
    Alternatively, you can directly select a file to display by running
    "jrc2 traces myparam.prm File#"
Bugfix: Projection view polygon cutting resulted in empty view when diagonal 
    channel views are selected. Now fixed.

[2017/4/2]
Bug-fix: cluster restore error resolved in "jrc2 manual".
Speed-up: post-cluster step is 2x faster thanks to parallelization.

[2017/03/31]
Added feature: exporting spike amplitudes in uV unit, organized by clusters
    "jrc2 export-spkamp myparam.prm (clu#)"
    This outputs Vpp, Vmin, Vmax to the workspace (cmrVpp_clu, cmrVmin_clu, cmrVmax_clu)

[2017/03/29]
Compiled for GPU with >4GB memory (nvcc -m 64 -arch sm_35)
    Supporting NVIDIA GPU with compute capatiliby 3.5 or later
    Kepler, Maxwell and Pascal architecture (circa 2013, GeForce 700 series or later)
UI time view debugged. Channel switching behavior fixed.

[2017/03/28]
UI error fixed: Waveform error after splitting/merging
Kilosort compilation script
"jrc2 export-spkwav" command added. This exports spike waveforms from all clusters.
    run "jrc2 export-spkwav unit#" to export and plot spikes from a specified unit#.

[2017/03/26]
Significant improvement in UI startup and cluster selection speed.
Waveform display fixed. Previously displayed differentiated waveform.

[2017/03/24]
Fixed a slow startup for jrc2 manual

[2017/02/24]
JRCLUST ver 2 update (run jrc2)
    Unit test added
    Memory-efficient sorting (jrc2)

Fixed GUI command "File>export waveform". Now correct waveform is saved.

[2016/10/25]
Default parameters changed (delta1_cut, dc_percent) to improve the sorting outcome, 
    now splits clusters less.

[2016/10/20]
jrc makeprm supports merging multiple files for multi-shank probe. 
    You need to create a probe file for each shank to use this feature.
    Copy the probe file(myprobe_shank1.prb) to the jrclust folder and run
    "jrclust makeprm 'c:\directory\data_1*.bin' myprobe_shank1.prb
    This will merge the .bin files to data_1all.bin file and create 
    'data_1all_CNT_4x16probe_shank1.prm' in where the .bin file resides.
    you can then run "jrclust spikesort" to sort the data
You don't need to specify .prm file after you specify once. for example,
    After running "jrclust makeprm myparam.prm", you can simply run
    "jrclust spikesort" and it will automatically use "myparam.prm".
You can use "jrc" instead of "jrclust".
Template file is now supported. Try
    "jrclust makeprm rawdata.bin myprobe.prb my_template.prm"

[2016/10/11]
jrc manual debugged. The waveforms are now scaled and displayed correctly. Previously the software showed differentiated waveform when the differentiation filter was enabled.

[2016/10/9]
Added FFT-cleanup procedure which removes narrow-band noise. set 'fft_thresh=0' to disable. fft_thresh=10 recommended (z-score threshold).
More efficient handle on the raw waveform (S0.mrWav moved to global variable).

[2016/10/5]
More efficient local common average referencing

[2016/9/29]
Default settings updated
Spacetime feature uses minimum amplitude

[2016/9/27]

[2016/9/20]
GPU errror during filtering fixed.
Default settings changed.

[2016/8/30]

[2016/8/28]
Background noise cancellation (set fMeanSite=2 for local median subtraction)
Added 'moment' feature. This projects spikes to mean, sqrt(mean), mean.^2

[2016/8/21]
2x faster file loading using GPU for combining loading/processing operation.
2x faster and more accurate spike detection.
Currently process 5x realtime speed for 120 channels, 1.2x realtime for 374 channels

[2016/8/18]
2x faster filtering and spike detection using multiple CPU cores.

[2016/8/15]
"jrclust auto" algorithmic update
    Graded rho/delta calculation
    Determine clustered distance distribution
    Use gradual drop-off spatial windowing instead of shart drop-off and increaes the range.
Improved automated clustering (Waveforms are now centered before projecting principal components).
Faster feature computation for manual curation.

[2016/8/14]
Documentation updated. Show the latest documentation by running ("JRCLUST doc").
Fixed "jrclust install" and "jrclust update" commands.
"jrclust makeprm" now supports multi-file merging using a wild-card. 
    Run "jrclust makeprm myfiles_*.bin myprobe.prb" and JRCLUST will create 
    "myfiles_all.bin", "myfiles_all.meta" and "myfiles_all.prm"

[2016/8/12]
Added auto split/merging when 'spca' feature is used ("postCluster.m").
Added an option to use amplitude-scaled dc (distance-cutoff) parameter for R-L clustering.
    Try dc_frac = 1/3; and use (vcCluDist = 'neucldist';). This sets a radius parameter to 
    compute "rho" parameter in R-L clustering for each individual spikes. Small spikes will
    use smaller radius and large spikes will use larger radius scaled by the norm of vector.
    Previously I used the same dc_frac parameter for all spike amplitudes which resulted in
    over-merging for smaller spikes and over-splitting for larger spikes.
Added "jrclust compile" for recompiling the CUDA GPU codes.
Features are not saved but computed on-fly. This saves lots of memory and time.
default.prm updated. Try the new default configuration which allow much 
    1. more sensitive spike detection
    2. much faster and memory-efficient feature handling
    3. more accurate automated sorting.

Added "Save figures" under File menu ("jrclust manual").
More sensitive spike detection. Set vcSpatialFilter = "mean" and fPcaDetect = 1.
Time view can display second and third principal components ("jrclust manual").
sPCA feature added. Cluster by channel.

[2016/8/1]
Fixed "jrclust makeprm" command
Fixed "jrclust download" command

[2016/7/28]

Can work with files that were stopped abruptly during recording (multiple of nChans requirement relaxed).

[2016/06/10]
+GUI: Press 's' to autosplit in the waveform view
+ added a feature to reject spikes during movement. Movement is detected FROM the global mean across channel (common reference). Motion is defined when the absolute value of the mean across sites exceed 5 SD. 
    Set "thersh_mean_rejectSpk=5" under "detection" section to change the threshold. Set this to 0 to skip motion rejection.
+File saving speed-up. Feature tensor (trFet) is saved in a binary format (.fet).
+PCA speed-up and reduction in memory usage.
