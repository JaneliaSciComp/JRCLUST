--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2019/1/5: v3.2.5]
Centered cluster average waveforms are properly saved. 
  `trWav_spk_clu` for filtered waveforms and `trWav_raw_clu` for raw waveforms
  `tmrWav_spk_clu` and `tmrWav_raw_clu` have worked properly, which saves
  waveforms at all sites.
Selecting 'vpp' (peak-to-peak voltage) calcultes different values
  depending on whether you are displaying filtered or raw waveforms.
  When 'pca' or 'ppca' (private pca) features are selected, PCA values are computed for the filtered waveforms whether or not the raw waveforms are displayed.
Manual GUI: The x-axis labels on the waveform view are displayed without overlapping for smaller sized monitors.
  To avoid overlapping, the text size is decresased and text angle is rotated (new feature since Matlab 2016b).

# New features
Manual GUI: 'ppca' (private PCA) option is added under "Projection" menu.
  When one unit is selected, filtered spike waveforms are projected to the first and second principal vectors of the selected unit for each site.
  When two units are selected, filtered spike waveforms are projected to the first principal axes of the two selected units for each site.
"jrc export-chan myparam.prm chan-list" exports channel(s) on "chan-list" to the Matlab workspace and to a binary file (_ch#.jrc).
  To export more than one channel, use "," or ":" without space. 
  For example, run "jrc export-chan 33,34,35" or "jrc export-chan 33:35" to export channels 33-35.
"jrc export-lfp" to export the LFP waveforms (ordered by the site numbers) to the Matlab workspace
  "mnLfp" has a nSamples x nSites dimension, and stores the LFP waveforms in the original data type (16-bit integer by default).
  "mrSiteXY" has a nSites x 2 dimension, and stores x and y coordinate for the sites (in micrometers)
  To extract a column of sites located at x=0, run "mnLfp(:, mrSiteXY(:,1)==0)"

[2019/1/4: v3.2.4]
# Bug fixes
Manual GUI: projection display is correctly updated.
  Previously the second unit selection (shown in red) required two right clicks to update.

[2019/1/3: v3.2.3]
Bugfix: incorrect "gather" function was called for R2017b when Bigdata toolbox is installed.
Faster and more robust fft_clean operation (run if `fft_thresh` > 0)
  It can handle a limited GPU memory.
`nLoads_gpu` parameter is introduced, which is the ratio of the system memory (RAM) to GPU memory.
  If your GPU memory size is 12 GB and RAM is 96 GB, set nLoads_gpu = 8.
  Increase this value if GPU error occurs (default: 8), do not change the default value otherwise.
  `nSamples_gpu` is now deprecated, and automatically calculated from `nLoads_gpu` parameter.

[2017/12/30: v3.2.2]
Bugfix: PSTH histogram plot error is fixed and two PSTH plots are displayed
  top and bottom when two units are selected.

[2017/12/29: v3.2.1]
Old multishank probe file format is supported (v1, jrclust.m). 
  'cviShank' which is a cell containing a list of sites is converted to 'shank' format
FFT clean operation is faster now (used if "fft_clean" parameter is greater than 0)
Manual GUI: Number of spikes per unit displayed the x-axis label can be toggled by pressing 'n' 
Manual GUI: performance improvement
  Faster update when a unit is selected
  Faster PSTH plot
  Default log length decreased to 5 from 10 previously ('MAX_LOG' parameter).
New command: "jrc quality myparam.prm"
  This command displays the unit quality info and exports to a csv file (ends with "_quality.csv").

[2017/12/21: v3.2.0]
Bugfix (Manual GUI): Unit selection cursors do not disappear anymore after file saving.
  This has been an issue since v3.1.8 with an introduction of saving the 
  cluster selection plot (rho vs. delta for the DPCLUS clustering algorithm).
Bugfix ('maketrial' command): Supports binary files with header information and/or
  multiple combined recordings if multiple binary files are set in "csFile_merge" parameter.
Speed improvement: "delete/merge/split" operation for Manual GUI got significantly faster
  Removed unnecessary visual updates and text box display for the unit counts, which is now
  shown on the x-axis as "unit# (counts)". The text box indicating the unit count used to
  block the waveforms and took a long time to plot.
"jrc clear mybatch.batch" will clear the output of the .prm files listed the batch text file (.batch).
LFP-related commands are migrated from jrclust.m (ver. 1)
  "jrc import-lfp" extracts LFP signal by subsampling the raw traces or by loading 
    the LFP file (.imec.lf.bin) for Neuropixels recordings.
  LFP file name (.lfp.jrc) is automatically generated from .prm file and 
    `vcFile_lfp` parameter is updated in .prm file.
  Subsampling is done by averaging the time bin (P.nSkip_lfp) to prevent aliasing 
    as opposed to simply skipping samples.
  "jrc traces-lfp" plots the LFP traces with a larger time window by a factor of P.nSkip_lfp.
    This works similarly to "jrc traces" command for viewing wide-band traces.

[2017/12/15: v3.1.10]
New parameter: `nSamples_gpu` which sets the number of samples to be loaded to GPU memory.
  Current default is 250,000, and previous default was 1000,000 which could not be changed.
  Reduce this number if you run out of GPU memory.  
  This value is used if P.fft_thresh > 0 or "P.vcCommonRef=='whitening'".
New parameter: 'fSpatialMask_clu' is disabled by default (previously enabled)
  Spatial mask applies spatially decaying weight as a function of distance from the center site
  `maxDist_site_um` is used as the half-distance scale (1/2 weight is multiplied at that distance)
  Spatial masking is disabled if you have less than "min_sites_mask" number of sites per spiking events.
n-trode geometry is now supported (n>=1). You need to set each tetrode group as separate shanks by setting 
  `shank` parameter in the .prb file for each site number. 
  (e.g.) if site 1:4 belongs to tetrode 1 and site 5:8 belongs to tetrode 2, then set "shank = [1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2];";
Bugfix: Spikes near the beginning of the recordings are now properly merged (spkMerge_single_() function).
New options for common-mode rejection: 'vcCommonRef' now supports 'median' and 'whitening'.
  Setting `vcCommonRef` = 'whitening' will perform spatial whitening between channels.
Trace GUI: color of spikes remains consistent between time window switching.
Manual GUI: Bugfix: Combination of selecting 'raw waveform' view in 'pca' unit works properly.
New feature: "maketrial" command
  This function generates trial timestamps to plot PSTH (either rising or falling edges) and generates .mat file
    containing timestamps and sets 'vcFile_trial' field.
  For IMEC probes, use "maketrial-imec" to extract event input on the digital input pins (1-16). 
    Specify the digital input channel by setting "dinput_imec_trial".

[2017/12/6: v3.1.9]
Bugfix: v3.1.8 incorrectly points to v3.1.7 on Github. Please download this version instead.
Bugfix: Opening previously sorted data (v3.1.1) to the latest vresion now works.
  Parameter version upgrade function (upgrad_param_()) now handles new way to compute 
  maxSite and nSites_ref parameters.

[2017/12/6: v3.1.8]
New feature: Rho-Delta plot is captured as .png file when _jrc.mat file is saved
  Setting the parameter 'fSavePlot_RD = 0' will disable the figure capture (enabled by default).
  You may adjust 'rho_cut' and 'delta1_cut' paramters based on the Rho-Delta plot.
  Run 'jrc plot-rd' command to view the Rho-Delta plot.
Manual GUI
  Unit position view displays number of spikes in a selected unit
  Bugfix: Clusters with less than 6 spikes after manual splitting doesn't crash any more.
  Bufix: Second manual splitting erases the first drawn polygon (splitting in the waveform view)
  Bugfix: Switching between filtered and raw waveforms now use the same set of colors
Improved error reporting: "jrc_error_log.mat" records detailed error log.
Raw waveform duration is reverted back to 2 msec
  spkLim_raw_factor = 2 (default) will use 2x of the time range (spkLim_ms) used for the filtered waveform 
  spkLim_factor_merge = 1 (default) will use 1x of the spkLim_ms (1 msec default) for the waveform based auto-merging
New default: maxDist_site_spk_um = 75 (changed from 70) for improved performance for probes with 25 um site spacing

[2017/12/1: v3.1.7]
Bugfix: Feature projection view
  Correct y-axis values (PC2) are plotted when splitting on the diagonal 
  site pairs when PCA feature is selected. 
Speed improvement: fft_clean operation (fft_thresh parameter) is performed faster.
New feature: Auto-splitting now supports manual splitting in three PC dimensions.
  Auto-split now offers three choices: {'yes', 'no', 'manual'}.
  Select "manual" and choose the projection ('PC1 vs PC2', 'PC3 vs PC2', 'PC1 vs PC3').

[2017/11/20: v3.1.6]
Bugfix: Nested S0 struct is removed when older version is loaded.
Drift correction is improved. Three average waveforms are computed by grouping
  spikes from similar center-of-mass. Now using all spikes from the same unit
  previously used spikes that were centered at the peak site only.
New parameter: fSpatialMask_clu (1 by default) applies spatial masking to 
  the features. Half decay length set by the maxDist_site_um.
Added support to import hdf5 dataset from the Ed Boyden lab recordings for 
  paired intracellular recording validation.


[2017/11/5: v3.1.5]
Bugfix: 'jrc describe' failed to report clustering time
Bugfix: Probe file backward compatibility added
  Failed if 'maxSite' exists but 'nSites_ref' doesn't exist in the probe file (.prb)
  Now nSites_ref is computed based on 'maxDist_site_spk_um' (see wiki)
  Probe files are first searched in ./prb/ location and elsewhere if not found
Bugfix: 'jrc update' command now copies sub-folders and backup files correctly
  Previously subfolders didn't get copied and files were not back-up properly.
  **Run 'jrc update' twice to get proper updates, since you need to run a new update script.**

[2017/11/3: v3.1.4]
JRCLUST repository moved to JanalieSciComp
  https://github.com/JaneliaSciComp/JRCLUST

[2017/11/1: v3.1.3]

  Max. distance separation of the peak sites to consider merging based on the unit waveform similarity
Bugfix: auto-merge now computes the self-correlation of the waveform correlation matrix

[2017/10/27: v3.1.1]
Bugfix: PSTH time offset error is removed (0.01 s previously)
Manual GUI: Speed improvement when selecting a unit.
Bugfix: raw waveform display fixed for the manual GUI. 
  Waveforms did not display if you used an older .prm file
New paramter: fInterp_fet = 1 (default), set to 0 to disable this new feature since v3.0.8
  This interpolates the spike waveforms 2x and finds the optimal time-lag to project the principal vector.
New paramter: fDrift_merge = 1 (default). Set to 0 to disable this new feature since v3.0.8
  This compares mean unit waveforms at three drift locations based on the spike position (CoM).
New paramter: nInterp_merge = 2 (default), set to 1 to disable this new feature since v3.0.8
  This compares mean unit waveforms at three drift locations based on the spike position (CoM).
Bugfix: Annotations previously got deleted when deleting clusteres using "delete-auto" command.
Manual GUI: "auto-merge" to automatically merge units based on the waveform correlations.

[2017/10/26: v3.1.0]
Bugfix: raw waveform display fixed for the manual GUI. 
  Waveforms did not display if you used an older .prm file
'fir1' filter is supported for "vcFilter" parameter.
  Finite Impulse Response filter
  The frequency range is sett by "freqLim=[f_low, f_high]" parameter.
New default: Detection threshold set to "qqFactor = 5".
  Increasing the detection threshold can incorrectly merge large amplitude units with background noise.
New default: Auto-calculation of maxSite and nSites_ref based on the physical distance.
  maxSite=[] and nSites_ref=[] will automatically set it based on the site spacing and layout.
  The parameter "maxDist_site_um" is used to determine the number of sites used for features (default 50 um)
  The parameter "maxDist_site_spk_um" is used to determine the number of reference sites (default 75 um)

[2017/10/25: v3.0.9]
Faster auto-splitting. Now displaying three principal component axis.
  Individual spike waveforms are no longer displayed but mean waveforms are displayed
  nSites_ref (reference sites) are not included in the auto-splitting projection
Faster updates for manual GUI. Refresh speed increased when user selects a unit.
Bugfix: Waveform correlation matrix error fixed.

[2017/10/24: v3.0.8]
Faster manual GUI loading speed. Optimized caching
Improved drift resistance. Three average unit waveforms are computed based on the vertical spike positions,
  and waveform similarities are compared for spatial and temporal shifts.
Faster post-hoc automated merging by using parfor (parallel computing toolbox)
Bugfix: manual GUI waveform similiarity matrix calculation.
Bugfix: Removed a horizontal curve from the rho-delta plot.
Bugfix: Manual GUI will clear the unsaved results when user selects "do not save".
  Previously cached information was incorrectly shown when the manual GUI was restarted.
New default: Raw spike waveform duration is now the same as the filtered spike waveform length.
  spkLim_ms = [-.25, .75]; sets the spike waveform range to 0.25 ms before the negative peak and 0.75 ms after the peak. 
  Setting spkLim_raw_ms = []; will set spkLim_raw_ms = spkLim_ms.

[2017/10/9]
Default changed: nPcPerChan=1 (previously 3), since other PC dimensions explain less than
  2% of the total variance when differentiator filter is used. Using only the first PC is 
  also more robust to the presence of overlapping spikes.
New default filter: vcFilter = 'ndiff' (convolves with [1,2,-2,-1] if nDiff_filt=2 chosen). 
  The new differentiator filter is less attenuating than 'sgdiff' for small spikes,
    which convolves with [2,1,0,-1,-2] if nDiff_filt=2 is chosen.
Default changed: fRepeat_clu=0 (previously 1)
  Repeating clustering is not necessary if lower feature dimension is used (nPcPerChan=1).
Default changed: delta1_cut=0.6 (previously 0.5) if lower feature dimension is used.
Improved auto-merging based on mean unit waveforms using interpolation
  Unit waveform similarity matrix is computed by finding the maximum correlation score 
    by relatively time-shifting waveform pairs after interpolating 4x in time.
Bugfix: Diagonal waveform similarity is calculated correctly after merge and subtract
Reduced the peak memory use by 50%. Spike waveforms are directly saved to the disk.
  fRamCache = 1; is set to default, which stores both the raw and filtered spike waveforms in RAM.
  Setting "fRamCache = 0" will only load either raw or filtered spike waveforms in RAM to save space.

[2017/10/8: v3.0.7]
Improved automated clustering for small amplitude units
  For feature extraction, vcSpkRef='nmean' now subtracts the average spike waveform across sites 
  excluding the nearest half of the sites from the center site. Previously the Local average was 
  calculated by excluding only the center site.

[2017/10/8: v3.0.6]
Improved automated clustering
  Setting the flag fRepeat_clu=1 (default) will re-runs clustering for the lower half of the cluster amplitudes.
  For Neuropixels probes, the default number of sites for feature extraction is increased:
    nSites_spk = 1+2*maxSite-nSites_ref = 1+6.5*2-4 = 10
CUDA codes are recomplied to accept up to 45 feature dimensions (previously 30).
  The max number of dimensions is stored in "nC_max" parameter (read-only, do not change).

[2017/9/29]
Bugfix: negative rho is fixed. This was caused by dc==0 (radius of the neighbor-finding spheres)
  when the median distance-cutoff was zero. This is fixed by discarding zero-distance values before
  calculating the quantile values.
Display fix: curves in rho-delta plot (bottom-right plot in the manual view) is suppressed.
  These spikes come from delta==0 values whose nearest pair has exactly same feature scores.
  These spikes are now hidden from the display.
"jrc gui" menu items are disabled if can't run given the current state, just like the buttons do.
Current version number of JRCLUST is overwritten in P.version after running.

[2017/9/28]
New user interface: jrc gui
  It opens a GUI that allows users to access majority of the JRCLUST commands via menu or buttons.
  This is recommended for new users who are not familiar with JRCLUST commands.
"jrc git-pull version#" will download a specific version # tag.
  "jrc git-pull" will download the latest release.
Bugfix: "version" field in .prm file is correctly updated.

[2017/9/27]
Added a parameter validater. Incorrect parameter values will be rejected with warning messages.
Bugfix: "vcFilter" issue is resolved for older format.

[2017/9/26]
jrc can run from any path after adding path to the jrclust location
  Run "addpath('jrclust_location')". Note that this doesn't persist after Matlab restart.
"jrc git-pull" updates JRCLUST from the Github repository
  https://github.com/jamesjun/JRCLUST
  git must be installed in Windows (https://git-scm.com/download/win).
Probe file moved to "./prb" folder. 
  The prm files is backward compatible. 
  .prb files will be searched in './prb/' folders if not found in the main JRCLUST folder.
Added "jrc wiki" command. 
  It opens a JRCLUST wiki webpage, a new home for the JRCLUST documentation.
Unit test is expanded.
  "jrc preview" GUI is added.
"jrc version" command is added.
  It displays the current version and the date updated.

[2017/9/17]
Bugfix: Program crashed when the number of clusters were less than 7.
  The color grouping size is 7 (# colors for cluster mean waveforms).
  Now it's possible to have any number of clusters.
Speed improvement (~40%) when fft cleanup is disabled (set fft_thresh=0).
  Previously unnecessary data conversion was performed even when fft cleanup is not used.
jrc import-nsx myrecording.ns5 myprobe.prb
  JRC imports Neuroshare format and export the analog channels to .bin file.
  JRC generates .prm file by combining the .bin and .prb file names (e.g. binfile_prbfile.prm) 

[2017/9/15]
jrc import-intan mychannels-A*.dat myprobe.prb
  JRC imports intan recordings, which saved each channel as -A###.dat files.
  JRC combines .dat files to a single .bin file and saves to the directory above.
  JRC generates .prm file by combining the .bin and .prb file names (e.g. binfile_prbfile.prm) 

[2017/9/14]
Bugfix: Waveform correlation based auto-merging
  Some cluster pairs were not merged although their correlation is above the maxCorWav threshold
jrc makeprm myfile.bin mytemplate.prm
  This create a prm file based on a template file for a given .bin file
jrc batch filelist.batch mytemplate.prm
  This creates .prm files for the list of .bin files using mytemplate.prm
  If mytemplate.prm is not specified, default.prm is used
jrc batch fileliist.batch command
  This command works for batch file containing .prm files. 
  Default command is spikesort if omited
jrc batch fileliist.batch command
  This command works for batch file containing .prm files. 
  Default command is spikesort if omited
jrc3 export-prm myparams.prm (myparam_full.prm)
  Export complete list of parameters to a new file.
  If the second argument is omitted, the current parameter file is updated.
  If some parameter values are missing, they will be copied from the default template file (default.prm).
New feature: when myparam_jrc.mat file is written, myparam_full.prm is created that contains the full parameter settings
  If the parameter file name is myparam.prm, jrc creates myparam_full.prm whenever myparam_jrc.mat is updated

[2017/9/12]
Improved rho-delta detrending
  lin-log fit using quadatic function, delta1_cut=0.6, rho_cut=-3 recommended
  Previously used log-log fit using linear function
Waiting hour-glass icon error is resolved.

[2017/8/18]
"jrc preview" UI is backward compatible with Matlab R2015b.
User interface: waiting dialog while plotting to prevent keyboard press while busy.

[2017/8/17]
Display bugfix: jrc traces spike display fixed
New user interface: jrc preview
  Change and preview threshold and sorting paramters
  Find optimal thresholds for motion rejection (blank_thresh), adaptive notch filter (fft_thresh), spike threshold (qqFactor).
  Save spike threshold per channel to a file ("vcFile_thresh = myparam_thresh.mat") and apply them to the entire recordings.  
  Auto-commit changes to the .prm file  
  Detect bad sites using max. pairwise correlation of cleaned raw traces (after notch filter and before AP-band filter).
Spike detection improved for smaller and narrower spikes
  Negative turning point detection uses different algorithm by checking left and right neighbors.
    Previously it was possible to randomly miss some of a negative turning point that has less than two neighbors below threshold.

[2017/8/7]
Bugfix: when multiple files are merged, the file ordering will follow the correct order
  by using the file creation time is stored in the .meta file (SpikeGLX generated).
    If .meta file is not availble, file creation time is used to sort the files.
"jrc dir file*.bin mylist.txt" will generate a list of binary files and 
  order them according to the file creation time.
You can specify a file sorting option at the end "jrc dir file*.bin mylist.txt [0-4]".
  0: alphabetical order
  1: meta file stored file creation time
  2: file created time
  3: file modified time
  4: numerical order in the file names   
"jrc makeprm mylist.txt myprobe.prb" will create a prm file called "mylist_myprobe.prm".
  'makeprm' now accepts .txt file containing list of binary files
  If .meta file (SpkeGLX) is available, it will be used to auto-fill the .prm file.
  If .meta file is unavailable, user will be asked to provide required info (sampling rate, # channels/file, uV/bit, probe file).

[2017/8/4]
`blank_period_ms` is now using millisecond unit. Previous it was using second unit.

[2017/8/2]
Bugfix: `makeprm` sometimes couldn't create .prm file. Now fixed.

[2017/8/1]
Bugfix: `makeprm` sometimes couldn't locate .meta file. Now fixed.

[2017/7/31]
'makeprm' command now works with a wild-card file path (csFile_merge = 'f*.bin')
  e.g. "jrc makeprm mybin*.bin myprobe.prb" creates a parameter file "mybin_myprobe.prm" by removing '*' characters and adding the probe file name.
  makeprm assumes the file format is the same for all binary files (same number of channels, sampling rate, uV/bit).
Multiple file joining (csFile_merge) now currectly orders files with numbers ('f1.bin', 'f2.bin', 'f10.bin'}
  Previously the files are ordered according to the modified timestamp. 
    The listing order can fail if the files get copied to another location, by alphabetically sorting the file order {'f1.bin', 'f10.bin', 'f2.bin'}
csFile_merge now accepts cell arrrays of wild-card
  csFile_merge = {'f1*.bin', 'f2*.bin'} is now valid.
  csFile_merge = {'f1*.bin', 'f2.bin'} is now valid.
  csFile_merge = {'f1*.bin', 'f2.bin', 'f3*.bin'} is now valid.
  csFile_merge = {'f1.bin', 'f2.bin'} is still valid.
  csFile_merge = 'f1*.bin' is still valid.

[2017/7/26]
vcFile_trial supports csv file format. 

[2017/7/25]
makeprm command can automatically determine the Neuropixels probe option from the meta file.
  If the probe is not a Neuropixels probe, user is asked to provide the probe file name.
  Call "jrc makeprm myrecording.bin myprobe.prb" to explicitly state the probe file.

[2017/7/23]
"jrc traces" UI improvement. 
  Filter on/off is indicated on the figure title bar.
  Mouse pointer changes while loading the data.
  'vcFilter_show' can override the filter setting for display purpose.
    Choices: {'', 'bandpass', 'sgdiff'}. '' uses vcFilter setting.

[2017/7/21]
Default parameter file template (default.prm) is cleaned up.
  Deprecated parameters and developer's parameters are organized separately.
SpikeGLX-generated .meta file is no longer required.
  If the meta file is missing, user is asked to provide sampling rate, uV/bit scaling factor and number of channels stored in the file.
Quality score now includes the microvolt amplitude unit.
  Minimum (S_clu.vrVmin_uv_clu) and peak-to-peak (S_clu.vrVpp_uv_clu) amplitudes from the center site is calculated.
UI: Automated deletion is implemnted. Clusters are automatically deleted based on the criteria
  Based on Unit SNR (Filtered peak amplitude divided by the RMS (Quiroga) for the primary channel
  Based on the # spike/unit.
  Undo is possible after automatic deletion.
UI: PCA feature display uses global principal vectors if vcFet='gpca' feature is used.
  Previously PCA feature display used principal vectors computed for each site.
  Site-specific principal vectors are used if vcFet='gpca' feature is not used.
Bugfix: quality metrics are now updated after manual cluster editing (delete,merge,split).
Bugfix: # of clusters displayed in "Cluster rho-delta" plot is corrected.
Cluster integrity is now automatically checked after each manual operation. 
  All cluster-related fields must have the same number of clusters.
  Manual operation is updated if and only if the automated cluster integrity check succeeds.

[2017/7/19]
New clustering feature is implemented (vcFet='gpca'). This feature is now a default feature.
  The performance of 'gpca' feature resulted in 50% lower median false positives and lower false negatives compared to the 'cov' feature.
  'nPcPerChan=3' sets number of features per channel.
There is now a filter option called (vcFilter='sgdiff'). Set this to (vcFilter='bandpass') if you want to apply a bandpass IIR filter. 
  The option below are for the Savitzky-Golay differentiator filter (vcFilter='sgdiff'), which is set by default.
    Set 'nDiff_filt=2' to set the filter tap order (+/-2 samples). Increasing this number will smooth the signal and decreasing will sharpen the signal.
  The options below are for the bandpass IIR filter (vcFilter='bandpass').
    Set 'freqLim=[300 6000]' to apply a bandpass filter from 300-6000 Hz. 
    Set 'freqLim=[300 inf]' to apply a high-pass filter with a 300 Hz cut-off.
    Set 'freqLim=[0 300]' to apply a low-pass filter with a 300 Hz cut-off.
    Set 'fEllip=1' to apply an Elliptic filter. Set it to 0 if you want to use a Butterworth filter.
    Set 'filtOrder=3' to apply a third-order bandpass filter.
'vcDetrend_postclu=global' option results in a more reliable detrending for the cluster center finding (rho-delta plot). 
  Default parameter values are set to delta1_cut=0.6, rho_cut=-3.
  delta1_cut indicate log10(z-score). For example, delta1_cut=0.6 corresponds to z_thresh = 10^0.6 = 4.0 after detrending.

[2017/7/14]
"jrc batch my_prm_files.batch" command now lists list of errors found during the batch process
dc_percent behavior changed. Now dc_percent is applied to local neighbors sharing the same
  primary site only. Previously neighbors sharing primary or secondary sites were included,
  leading to overestimation of the distance-cutoff.
  dc_percent default value is set back to 2.
"vcFilter" paramter is added to clarify whether differentiation filter or bandpass filter is used.
  vcFilter='sgdiff' uses nDiff_filt value to run the Savitzky-Golay differentiator.
  vcFilter='bandpass' uses freqLim value to run a band-pass filter.
    Butterworth filter is used if "fEllip=0", and otherwise elliptic filter is used.
  'filtOrder=3' sets the filter order to 3.
Drift view shows spikes from a specific shank. Modify iShank_show=1 in the prm file (shows the first shank by default).


[2017/7/13]
Bugfix: L12677 index range error is fixed
 viKeep_spk = find(viTime_spk >= ilim_spk(1) & ilim_spk <= ilim_spk(2));

[2017/7/12]
Matlab path is temporarily reset to the system default when JRCLUST starts 
  to prevent namespace collision error. The path is reset to user-specified 
  value after restarting the Matlab session.

[2017/7/7]
Waveform merging now checks other clusters whose primary or secondary sites 
  overlap with the cluster's secondary site (second center).
default value of dc_percent changed (2->1). This results in lower false positives without affecting false negatives.
fft_thresh GPU error is corrected. 

[2017/7/6]
Quality metrics added: ISI ratio, L-ratio, Isolation Distance
  Variable names: "S_clu.{vrIsiRatio_clu, vrLRatio_clu, vrIsoDist_clu}"
  Local neighborhood is selected by searching for all spikes sharing the same 
    primary or secondary sites with the cluster center.
Bugfix: average waveform is recalculated after removing outlier spikes.
Bugfix: Multi-shank neighboring sites are calculated correctly, now always taken from the same shank.
ISI violation is automatically fixed by removing spikes that are double-detected.
"jrc manual": deleted spikes are now hidden.

[2017/7/5]
Neuropixels probe layout corrected. Channel 1 is in the middle column but previously it was on the edge
  (imec3.prb, imec3_opt1, imec3_opt2 imec3_opt3 imec3_opt4 corrected)

[2017/7/4]
Default parameter changed to improve spike detection and clustering.
  qqThresh = 5; nDiff_filt = 2;
Improved post-cluster merging based on the location of the primary and secondary peaks.
  Previously the merging decision was considered for cluster pairs within 50 um.
  The new scheme yields more specific cluster merging, thur reducing false cluster merges.
Removal of outlier spikes based on the Mahalnobis distance.
  thresh_mad_clu = 7.5; (default). Set to 0 to disable this.
  This will significantly reduce the false positive spikes with minimal increase of missed spikes.

[2017/6/29]
Matched filter detection is supported (set vcFilter_detect = 'matched';)
  This convolves the spike wave shape to the filtered traces. 

[2017/6/27]
Bugfix: JRC3 now supports energy and PCA features.
Significantly more reliable spike detection at the edges of memory loading blocks. 
  Extra spike detected due to the edge effect is ~0.1 ppm per channel per memory load.
Hard threshold setting is fixed (spkThresh_uV).

[2017/6/23]
Bugfix: "traces" command multiple time segment viewing now adds time separators
  jrc2 and jrc3 updated and time offset values are shown.

[2017/6/22]

  nTime_traces = 1 shows a single time segment as previously.
GPU is disabled for manual curation (jrc manual)

[2017/6/19]
Code dependencies to external functions removed in jrc2 and jrc3.
Run "jrc3 dependencies" to show dependencies to toolboxes and other functions.

[2017/6/15]
Paged load uses overlapping time to reduce missed spikes at the edges due to filter edge effect.
  "nPad_filt" controls number of samples for overlap.
  This feature is added to both jrc2 and jrc3.

[2017/6/14]
JRCLUST version 3 is released. Run "jrc3" or "jrc" to use this version.
  Substantial improvement with dataset with probe drift. 
    Set "nTime_clu" to 1 if no drift occurs, 2 or higher if drift occurs fast
  "jrc3 detect" runs spike detection and feature extraction.
  "jrc3 sort" runs clustering and posthoc merging.
  "jrc3 auto" runs posthoc merging.
  "jrc3 manual, spikesort-manual, sort-manual, or auto-manual" runs manual UI.
Better global noise rejection by blanking noisy period.
  "blank_thresh" sets the MAD threshold for the channel mean-based activity rejection
  "blank_period_ms" sets the duration of the blanking. Useful to remove licking or motion artifacts  


[2017/6/6]
"jrc2 auto" command is added. This performs re-clustering after updating the
  post-clustering parameters such as "delta1_cut" (cluster confidence).
  This must be done after running "jrc2 sort" or "jrc2 spikesort".
  This command uses the features previously computed.
Local CAR now uses "nSites_ref" channels with the least activities (lowest stdev).
  Previously reference sites were selected by choosing four furthest sites from the center.
If vcSpkRef="nmean" is used, the features from the local reference sites are set to zero.
  This excludes features from the sites with low SNR.

[2017/6/4]
Robust GPU memory processing. If GPU memory error occurs during spike detection the 
  processing is performed in CPU after transfered the data to the main memory 

[2017/5/29]
Default setting changed to produce lower false negative under drift.
  Now checks 2x greater spatial range. This doesn't hurt performance for non-drifting dataset

  Lastest program state is automatically saved to the disk for each manual operation.

[2017/5/12]
Bugfix: Spike detection error fixed when refrac_factor >1 was used
  The previous version assigned an incorrect site # for the spike being detected.
  This is a serious bug and update is recomended.
Spike merging speed is improved.

[2017/5/6]
Bugfix: Multishank post-hoc merging error fixed
Added jrc2 batch-mat myfile_batch.mat command
 myfile_batch.mat contains csFile_bin (binary files) and csFile_template (template files)
 csFile_template can be a string or cell strings
 Optionally provide csFile_prb (probe files), which can be a string or cell strings (for each .bin file)

[2017/5/5]
History menu is added to GUI. This feature allows you to undo/redo manual actions,
  and restore to previous state if JRCLUST crashes. Restart JRCLUST and select 
  the last action saved in the "History" menu (left of Help menu).

[2017/5/3]
Bugfix: New update (4/26) can display older format saved.
Faster post-hoc merging
Faster merging and splitting
Improved visualization for the cluster correlation matrix (FigWavCor)

[2017/4/26]
'nneigh_min_detect' parameter is introduced. This sets the minimum number of neighbors around spikes
  below the negative detection threshold. Set between [0,1,2]. 1 is recommended.
  Previous version used hard-coded value of 2 which lead to missing spikes.

[2017/4/25]
'nDiff_filt' parameter is intorduced to control the smoothing parameter of the differentiator filter.   
  Set nDiff_filt between 1-4. 3 is recommended. Higher number results in more agressive smoothing. 
  Previous version used 4 but it smoothed too aggressively leading to loss of small and narrow spike waveforms
  To skip differentiator sgfilter, set nDiff_filt = []; 
'tlim_load' parameter is now enabled, which sets the time range of data to load (in sec unit).
  For multiple file merging, the time base refers to each individual file and it applies for all files being loaded

[2017/4/21]
Bugfix: Split selection refinement fixed (polygon adjustment didn't take effect)
Bugfix: Raw waveform display works with the dataset sorted by the previous version 
Spike position view (bottom-left) shows 4x more spikes
Color can be changed for projection view by changing 'mrColor_proj' in the .prm file
  mrColor_proj = [r0 g0 b0; r1 g1 b1; r2 g2 b2]; % 0: background; 1: Cluster selected; 2: Cluster compared

[2017/4/20]
Multiple feature viewing enabled. Go to menu and select 'Projection' to change features to display
  available features: {'vpp', 'cov', 'pca'}. This affects the projection and time figures.

  Run "jrc2 export-fet" and this outputs mrFet, miFet_sites to the workspace.

[2017/4/4]
Trace view: For multi-file sorting, you can select files from the command line 
    instead of from the dialog box, which sometimes run out of the monitor space.
    Alternatively, you can directly select a file to display by running
    "jrc2 traces myparam.prm File#"
Bugfix: Projection view polygon cutting resulted in empty view when diagonal 
    channel views are selected. Now fixed.

[2017/4/2]
Bug-fix: cluster restore error resolved in "jrc2 manual".
Speed-up: post-cluster step is 2x faster thanks to parallelization.

[2017/03/31]
Added feature: exporting spike amplitudes in uV unit, organized by clusters
    "jrc2 export-spkamp myparam.prm (clu#)"
    This outputs Vpp, Vmin, Vmax to the workspace (cmrVpp_clu, cmrVmin_clu, cmrVmax_clu)

[2017/03/29]

Default parameters changed (delta1_cut, dc_percent) to improve the sorting outcome, 
    now splits clusters less.

[2016/10/20]
jrc makeprm supports merging multiple files for multi-shank probe. 
    You need to create a probe file for each shank to use this feature.
    Copy the probe file(myprobe_shank1.prb) to the jrclust folder and run
    "jrclust makeprm 'c:\directory\data_1*.bin' myprobe_shank1.prb
    This will merge the .bin files to data_1all.bin file and create 
    'data_1all_CNT_4x16probe_shank1.prm' in where the .bin file resides.
    you can then run "jrclust spikesort" to sort the data
You don't need to specify .prm file after you specify once. for example,
    After running "jrclust makeprm myparam.prm", you can simply run
    "jrclust spikesort" and it will automatically use "myparam.prm".
You can use "jrc" instead of "jrclust".
Template file is now supported. Try
    "jrclust makeprm rawdata.bin myprobe.prb my_template.prm"

[2016/10/11]

Documentation updated. Show the latest documentation by running ("JRCLUST doc").
Fixed "jrclust install" and "jrclust update" commands.
"jrclust makeprm" now supports multi-file merging using a wild-card. 
    Run "jrclust makeprm myfiles_*.bin myprobe.prb" and JRCLUST will create 
    "myfiles_all.bin", "myfiles_all.meta" and "myfiles_all.prm"

[2016/8/12]
Added auto split/merging when 'spca' feature is used ("postCluster.m").
Added an option to use amplitude-scaled dc (distance-cutoff) parameter for R-L clustering.
    Try dc_frac = 1/3; and use (vcCluDist = 'neucldist';). This sets a radius parameter to 
    compute "rho" parameter in R-L clustering for each individual spikes. Small spikes will
    use smaller radius and large spikes will use larger radius scaled by the norm of vector.
    Previously I used the same dc_frac parameter for all spike amplitudes which resulted in
    over-merging for smaller spikes and over-splitting for larger spikes.
Added "jrclust compile" for recompiling the CUDA GPU codes.
Features are not saved but computed on-fly. This saves lots of memory and time.
default.prm updated. Try the new default configuration which allow much 
    1. more sensitive spike detection
    2. much faster and memory-efficient feature handling
